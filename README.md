# NebulaWorm

NebulaWorm
A Beautiful C# .NET USB & LAN Worm
Created by me. Doesn't work in Virtual Machines.
Spreads via LAN, USB, Autorun, hidden .txt.exe and .exe extensions, SMB share spreading, and more.
Attempts remote execution but that module is unstable.
Modular design, clean code — no chaos here.

Please do NOT use for malicious purposes. This worm only spreads and does not cause harm. It can be adapted for other worm-like functionalities.
